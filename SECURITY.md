- **Purpose**: Image Integrity Verification
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures image authenticity
  - Prevents supply chain attacks
  - Provides full chain of trust
  - Verifies image hasn't been tampered with

#### 3. **Container Security** üõ°Ô∏è
- **No Host Network**: Uses containerized networking only
- **Read-Only Mappings**: Minimal file system access
